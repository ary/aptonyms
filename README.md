# List of aptonyms

> An **aptronym**, **aptonym** or **euonym** is a personal name aptly or peculiarly suited to its owner.

I have always found it amusing when people's names correlate with their occupations. Some even say people tend to be attracted to occupations that fit their name (more about [nominative determinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominative_determinism)). Since I did not find any open list of aptonyms, I made one.
